## Description
-----------

This is a simple weather app built using JavaScript and the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location by entering the city name. To make the project work, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and update a constant APIKey in the `index.js` file with your API key.

5.  Open the `index.js` file in your preferred code editor.
6.  Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key by creating an account at [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign\_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
7.  In the `index.js` file, locate the following line:

    const APIKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

9.  Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
10.  Save the `index.js` file.

## Usage
